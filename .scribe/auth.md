# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {{sanctumToken}}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

To authenticate, pass your bearer token in the Authorization header like this: Bearer {{sanctumToken}}.
